# The challenge
The main goal of this kata was to create a string calculator that takes a string with several numbers as an input and returns a sum of said numbers in string format, with the following instructions:

- If the string is empty, it should return 0.

- The numbers can be separated by commas, newlines or other delimiters.

- Negative numbers should trigger an error listing all them.

- Numbers bigger than 1,000 should not be taken into account.

# Notes

- Since my version uses regex to find numbers in the string, it doesn't check for different delimiters â€“it simply ignores all of them. Since the kata description does not specify how to proceed if different delimiters are used, I have considered this to meet the requirements.

- The kata was relatively straightforward, so I tried to solve it without using loops for a bit of an extra challenge.

- Test are implemented with Mocha.
